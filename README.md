# STARA: A* Algorithm Implementations with Python, C++, Rust, ..., and Numba


## Overview

This project evaluates various implementation approaches of the **A* pathfinding algorithm**, starting with pure, naive Python, over standard library optimization, Nuitka compilation to binary files, Numba JIT compilation, Rust extensions with PyO3, and C++ extensions with pybind11. This analysis aims to identify practical performance improvement strategies with several degrees of implementation complexity.

## Key Findings

üî¨ **Benchmarking and analysis reveal that different problem sizes have different optimal solutions:**

- **Large workloads**: C++ extensions provide **6.51x speedup**
- **Small workloads**: Rust extensions achieve **14.2x speedup**  
- **Numba**: Shows inconsistent scaling behavior across different problem sizes
- **Standard library optimizations**: Surprisingly offered no improvement over naive implementations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Git
- Rust (for Rust implementation)
- Poetry (recommended for dependency management)
- C++ compiler (for C++ implementation)
- CMake 3.15+ (for C++ implementation)
- and probably more...

### Clone with Submodules

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/valerius21/stara.git
cd stara

# If you already cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Installation

Each implementation can be installed independently. Navigate to the desired implementation directory install it either with poetry or the standard way according to the used library/framework.

## Usage

### Basic A* Pathfinding

#### Using the Maze Generator with any implementation

```python
import numpy as np
from stara_maze_generator.vmaze import VMaze
from stara_maze_generator.pathfinder import Pathfinder

# Create a 20x20 maze
maze = VMaze(
    seed=42,              # Random seed for reproducibility
    size=20,              # Creates a 20x20 grid
    start=(1, 1),         # Starting position
    goal=(18, 18),        # Goal position
    min_valid_paths=3     # Minimum number of valid paths
)

# Generate the maze structure
# You can use any pathfinding algorithm from the Pathfinder class
# It is only used to generate the maze structure.
maze.generate_maze(pathfinding_algorithm=Pathfinder.BFS) 

# Find a path from start to goal
a_star = AStar(maze)
path = a_star.find_path()
print(f"Path found: {path}")
```

#### Using the C++ Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
from stara_cpp import load_maze, AStar

# Create a maze (0 = wall, ‚â•1 = passage)
maze = np.array([
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
], dtype=np.int32)

# Load maze and create pathfinder
maze_ptr = load_maze(maze)
pathfinder = AStar(maze_ptr)

# Find path from (0,0) to (4,4)
start = (0, 0)
goal = (4, 4)

try:
    path = pathfinder.find_path(start, goal)
    if path is not None:
        print("Path found:", path)
    else:
        print("No path found!")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print("Error:", str(e))
```

## Performance Analysis

### Methodology

The performance analysis was conducted using:
- Multiple maze sizes (10x10 to 1000x1000)
- Various obstacle densities (10% to 40%)
- Repeated trials for statistical significance
- Different hardware configurations

### Results Summary

| Implementation | Small Mazes | Medium Mazes | Large Mazes | Complexity Rating |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Naive Python | 1.0x | 1.0x | 1.0x | ‚≠ê (Low) |
| Standard Lib | 1.0x | 1.0x | 1.0x | ‚≠ê (Low) |
| Nuitka | 2.1x | 2.8x | 3.2x | ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium) |
| Numba | 8.5x | 4.2x | 2.1x | ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium) |
| Rust | **14.2x** | 8.7x | 5.3x | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High) |
| C++ | 10.1x | 7.2x | **6.51x** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High) |

## Research Context

This project serves as supplementary material for research into Python performance optimization techniques in high-performance computing environments. The findings demonstrate that:

1. **No silver bullet exists** - different approaches work better for different problem sizes
2. **Development complexity matters** - simpler optimizations may not provide sufficient improvements
3. **Native extensions excel** - but require language expertise and increased maintenance overhead
4. **JIT compilation is unpredictable** - performance gains vary significantly with problem characteristics
